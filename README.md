# Healthy - Mind
This is my very first website and I'm excited to share this with you all. This website was created using simple technologies. While designing each component of this website, the perfect balance of UI and UX was maintained.
## Features
Healthy-Mind provides a platform for an organization which focuses on Mental Health. It is a static website where articles that would motivate the reader can be displayed, and an option was provided to connect an individual to therapists.
## Built with üõ†Ô∏è
